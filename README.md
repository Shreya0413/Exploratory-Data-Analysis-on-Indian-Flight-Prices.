# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Indian-Flight-Prices.
## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian domestic flight ticket pricing. The analysis uncovers patterns and insights related to airline pricing, routes, departure times, and number of stops using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The dataset contains multiple CSV files with detailed information about flights between major Indian cities.

## 🔎 Key Steps Performed

- Data extraction and consolidation from multiple CSV files.
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, converting data types, extracting useful features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  - Price distribution analysis
  - Analysis of number of stops vs price
  - Airline-wise pricing comparisons
  - Route-based pricing trends
  - Departure time and price relationship
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Histogram of flight prices
- Boxplots of prices by number of stops
- Bar plots comparing airlines and pricing
- Route-based price comparisons
- Scatter plots of duration vs pricing

## 💡 Insights Derived

- Direct flights are generally more expensive than flights with multiple stops.
- Certain airlines consistently have higher or lower pricing bands.
- Routes and cities significantly affect ticket prices.
- Departure time influences pricing trends.
